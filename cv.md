## Briefly About Myself:
My path to becoming a front-end developer is rocky. I have been looking for myself and what I want to do for a long time, I managed to learn the Java programming language, tried myself as a tester and thank you for the fact that manual testing seemed terribly boring to me and I started learning Python to switch to automated testing.
While working with Python, a friend asked me to create a website for him, I agreed, tried it, I got a good project with HTML5 & CSS3 and some native CSS. And then a deep dive into the frontend started, it swallowed me completely and I found what I really like and what I want to do.
