### Briefly About Myself:
My path to becoming a front-end developer is rocky. I have been looking for myself and what I want to do for a long time, I managed to learn the Java programming language, tried myself as a tester and thank you for the fact that manual testing seemed terribly boring to me and I started learning Python to switch to automated testing.
While working with Python, a friend asked me to create a website for him, I agreed, tried it, I got a good project with HTML5 & CSS3 and some native CSS. And then a deep dive into the frontend started, it swallowed me completely and I found what I really like and what I want to do.
## Skills and Proficiency:
* JS, React
* HTML5 & CSS3
* BEM methodology
* Python
* GIT, GIT Extension, GIT Desktop
* MobaXtern
* VS Code, WebStorm, PyCharm,
* Postman, DevTools, Figma.

### Code example:
All my works are posted in my repository, the code is often very voluminous:
* https://github.com/VKryanin?tab=repositories

 * Python:
> import random
>
> game_status = True
> while game_status:
>    player_choice = input('Player choice: [paper/rock/scissors] \n').lower()
>    if player_choice not in ['paper', 'rock', 'scissors']:
>        print('Incorrect input. Try again')
>        continue
>    gen = {1:'paper', 2:'rock', 3:'scissors'}
>    comp_choice = gen[random.randint(1,3)]
>    print(f'Comp choice = {comp_choice}')
>    win_comb = [('paper', 'rock'), ('rock', 'scissors'),('scissors', 'paper')]
>    if player_choice == comp_choice:
>        print('A draw')
>    elif (player_choice, comp_choice) in win_comb:
>        print('Player wins')
>    else:
>        print('Comp wins')
>    game_status = input('Do you want priceed? [Yes/No]').lower() == 'yes'
